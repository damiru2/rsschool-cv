### Briefly about myself:

I started my career in a Kazakh-Italian company in my home country of Kazakhstan as an information technology inspector.
I have been working in this field for 5 years now.
Recently, I began to get involved in programming, studied the basic course on Python, and studied the Swift language for about 10 months.
My main goal is to become a good, in-demand programmer. My purposefulness, my diligence and dedication will help me in this.
I always try to learn new, unfamiliar things in the field of IT, every day after work I devote time to self-development.
Recently, on the advice of friends, I began to study front-end and decided to become a specialist in this particular direction.
